# docuware-client

This is a client library for the REST API of [DocuWare][1] DMS. Since [DocuWare's documentation][2] regarding the REST
API is very sparse (at the time these lines were written), this client serves only a part of the API's functionality.

Please keep in mind: This software is not related to DocuWare. It is a work in progress, may yield unexpected results,
and almost certainly contains bugs.


## Usage

First you have to log in and create a persistent session:

```python
import json
import pathlib
import docuware

dw = docuware.Client("http://localhost")
session = dw.login("username", "password", "organization")
with open(".session", "w") as f:
    json.dump(session, f)
```

From then on you have to reuse the session, otherwise you will be locked out of the DocuWare server for a period of
time (10 minutes or longer). As the session cookie may change on subsequent logins, update the session file on every
login.

```python
session_file = pathlib.Path(".session")
if session_file.exists():
    with open(session_file) as f:
        session = json.load(f)
else:
    session = None
dw = docuware.Client("http://localhost")
session = dw.login("username", "password", "organization", cookiejar=session)
with open(session_file, "w") as f:
    json.dump(session, f)
```

Iterate over the organizations and file cabinets:

```python
for org in dw.organizations:
    print(org)
    for fc in org.file_cabinets:
        print("   ", fc)
```

If you already know the ID or name of the objects, you can also access them directly.

```python
org = dw.organization("1")
fc = org.file_cabinet("Archive")
```

Now some examples of how to search for documents. First you need a search dialog:

```python
# Let's use the first one:
dlg = fc.search_dialog()
# Or a specific search dialog:
dlg = fc.search_dialog("Default search dialog")
```

Each search term consists of a field name and a search pattern. Each search dialog
knows its fields:

```python
for field in dlg.fields.values():
    print(field)
```

Get file cabinet fields as list:
```python
dlg = fc.search_dialog()
fc_fields = []
for field in dlg.fields.values():
    fc_field = {}
    fc_field["id"] = field.id
    fc_field["length"] = field.length
    fc_field["name"] = field.name
    fc_field["type"] = field.type
    fc_fields.append(fc_field)

print(fc_fields)
```

Let's search for some documents:

```python
# Search for DOCNO equal to '123456':
for result in dlg.search("DOCNO=123456"):
    print(result)
# Search for two patterns alternatively:
for result in dlg.search(["DOCNO=123456", "DOCNO=654321"], operation=docuware.OR):
    print(result)
```

Please note that search terms may also contain metacharacters such as `*`, `(`, `)`, which may need to be escaped when
searching for these characters themselves.

```python
for result in dlg.search("DOCTYPE=Invoice \\(incoming\\)"):
    print(result)
```

Search terms can be as simple as a single string, but can also be more complex. The following two queries
are equivalent:

```python
dlg.search(["FIELD1=TERM1,TERM2", "FIELD2=TERM3"])
dlg.search({"FIELD1": ["TERM1", "TERM2"], "FIELD2": ["TERM3"]})
```

The result of a search is always an iterator over the search results, even if no result was obtained.
Each individual search result holds a `document` attribute, which gives access to the document in the archive.
The document itself can be downloaded as a whole or only individual attachments.

```python
for result in dlg.search("DOCNO=123456"):
    doc = result.document
    # Download the complete document ...
    data, content_type, filename = doc.download(keep_annotations=True)
    docuware.write_binary_file(data, filename)
    # ... or individual attachments (or sections, as DocuWare calls them)
    for att in doc.attachments:
        data, content_type, filename = att.download()
        docuware.write_binary_file(data, filename)
```

Create data entry in file cabinet:
```python
data = {
    "FIELD1": "value1",
    "FIELD2": "value2",
}
response = fc.create_data_entry(data)
```

Update data fields of document. The _query_ parameter needs to return one single document. you can use a _for-loop_ to execute this function on multiple documents:
```python
fields = {
    "FIELD1": "value1",
    "FIELD2": 99999
}
response = fc.update_data_entry(["FIELD1=TERM1,TERM2", "FIELD2=TERM3"], user_fields)
```

Delete document(s):
```python
dlg = fc.search_dialog()
for result in dlg.search(["FIELD1=TERM1,TERM2", "FIELD2=TERM3"]):
    document = result.document
    document.delete(document)
```

Users and groups of an organisation can be accessed and managed:

```python
# Iterate over the list of users and groups:
for user in org.users:
    print(user)
for group in org.groups:
    print(group)

# Find a specific user:
user = org.get_user("Doe, John")

# Add a user to a group:
org.add_group_to_user("Finance", "Doe, John")

# Deactivate/activate a user:
org.deactivate_user("Doe, John")
org.activate_user("Doe, John")
```

For more details please use `help(docuware.client.Organization)`.


## CLI usage

This package also includes a simple CLI program for collecting information about the archive and searching and
downloading documents or attachments.

First you need to log in:

```console
$ dw-client login --url http://localhost/ --username "Doe, John" --password FooBar --organization "Doe Inc."
```

The credentials and the session cookie are stored in the `.credentials` and `.session` files in the current directory.

Of course, `--help` will give you a list of all options:

```console
$ dw-client --help
```

Some search examples (Bash shell syntax):

```console
$ dw-client search --file-cabinet Archive Customer=Foo\*
$ dw-client search --file-cabinet Archive DocNo=123456 "DocType=Invoice \\(incoming\\)"
$ dw-client search --file-cabinet Archive DocDate=2022-02-14
```

Downloading documents:

```console
$ dw-client search --file-cabinet Archive Customer=Foo\* --download document --annotations
```

Downloading attachments (or sections):

```console
$ dw-client search --file-cabinet Archive DocNo=123456 --download attachments
```

Some information about your DocuWare installation:

```console
$ dw-client info
```

Listing all organizations, file cabinets and dialogs at once:

```console
$ dw-client list
```

A more specific list, only one file cabinet:

```console
$ dw-client list --file-cabinet Archive
```

You can also display a (partial) selection of the contents of individual fields:

```console
$ dw-client list --file-cabinet Archive --dialog custom --field DocNo
```
